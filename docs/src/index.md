# Introduction

AlgebraOfGraphics defines a "plotting package agnostic" algebra of graphics based on a few simple building blocks that can be combined using `+` and `*`.

This package can be installed typing
```julia
(@v1.4) pkg> add AlgebraOfGraphics
```
in the Pkg REPL.

See [Tutorial](@ref) for examples on how to use it.
[Internals](@ref) gives more details about the internal workings of AlgebraOfGraphics.

If you prefer a more visual, interactive workflow, an example GUI is available in the [examples](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AlgebraOfGraphics.jl/tree/master/examples) folder.
